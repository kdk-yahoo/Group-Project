Yahoo Viral Digest
=============

Group Project by Mark Cwalinski, Kevin Keller and Suyog Kotecha

App based off of Yahoo News Digest, but with a focus on everything viral.

Essentially, users will receive a daily dump of ~10 of the most popular images, videos, stories, tweets, etc. around the web.  Can pull from sources such as youtube, twitter, yahoo sports, yahoo screen, reddit, etc.

The user stories we want to cover:
   * [] The user opens the app and sees a list of previews for social media stories.
   * [] The user can click on any to see more information.
   * [] From the detailed view the user can go back to the list.
   * [] The user can share the story.
   * [] The user can swipe left or right to see the next/previous story in the list.
   * [] The user can swipe down after getting to the end of the list to load additional stories. 
   * [] The app can make a notification and remind the user that they have unread stories.
   * [] There is a settings page for the user to modify their notification settings.
   * [] The user can see embeded tweets, reddit posts and youtube videos within the app.
Stretch Goals:
   * [] The user can sign in with their social media accounts and get customized top tweets and facebook posts. 
   * [] Make a splash screen the user can see while the app loads.
